This game is a ping pong game with a paddle and ball(s).
The goal is to score a certain amount of points without losing your ball(s).

Basics of the Game:
 - Each hit of a ball is one point.
 - The paddle shrinks every time it deflects a ball.
 - There is a minimum size the paddle can shrink to dependent on the amount of balls in the field.
 - A new ball spawns every time the score hits a 10s mark.
 - Everytime a new ball spawns the paddle grows slightly dependent on how many balls are in the field.
 - There is a maximum amount of balls allowed in the field which increases from the first ball missed, then for every four balls missed.
 - When a ball is missed, the paddle shrinks and the score decreases by an amount, both dependent on the number of balls.
